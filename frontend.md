# Frontend Setup and Running Instructions

This document outlines how to set up and run the OrxusPM frontend application, along with the necessary backend server.

## 1. Start the Laravel Backend Server

First, ensure your Laravel backend server is running. This will serve the API endpoints that the frontend consumes.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project root directory (`C:\laragon\www\OrxusPM`), and run the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will typically start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 2. Start the React Frontend Application

Next, start the React development server. This will serve the frontend application.

Open a **new** terminal or command prompt, navigate to the frontend application directory (`C:\laragon\www\OrxusPM\orxus-frontend`), and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the development server on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

## 3. Access the Application

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the `npm run dev` command (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Default User Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use the following default credentials:

**Admin User:**
- **Email:** `admin@orxus.com`
- **Password:** `password`

**Staff Users:**
- **Email:** (Check your database for generated staff emails, e.g., `user1@example.com`, `user2@example.com`)
- **Password:** `password` (for all staff users generated by the seeder)
